     <p><h3>Video Game Sales and Ratings</h3></p>
     <p><h3>Video game sales data from VGChartz with corresponding ratings from Metacritic</h3></p>
     <p><b>Context:</b></p>
     <p>This data set contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies along with critic and user ratings. It is a combined web scrape from VGChartz and Metacritic along with manually entered year of release values for most games with a missing year of release. The original coding was created by Rush Kirubi and can be found here, but it limited the data to only include a subset of video game platforms. Not all of the listed video games have information on Metacritic, so there data set does have missing values.</p>

      <p><h3>Some ideas about this dataset:</h3></p>
        <p>Are TOP 20 games exactly the same as EU market and global market? Is there any relationship?</p>
        <p>Is there any prolific game publisher based on this dataset? </p>
        <p>Try to figure out if there is any game that has not published for many years but have great sales among TOP 20 games. </p>
        <p>Do TOP 20 games all have high critic scores and user scores? </p>
        <p>What are the attributes of those games having large number of users? Do they have good sales too?</p>
        <p>What are the sales percentage of TOP 10 or 20 games?</p>
